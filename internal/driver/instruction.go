	// ADDRESSING MODES

	// The 6502 can address between 0x0000 - 0xFFFF. The high byte is often referred
	// to as the "page", and the low byte is the offset into that page. This implies
	// there are 256 pages, each containing 256 bytes.
	//
	// Several addressing modes have the potential to require an additional clock
	// cycle if they cross a page boundary. This is combined with several instructions
	// that enable this additional clock cycle. So each addressing function returns
	// a flag saying it has potential, as does each instruction. If both instruction
	// and address function return 1, then an additional clock cycle is required.

	//Address Mode: Immediate
	// The instruction expects the next byte to be used as a value, so we'll prep
	// the read address to point to the next byte
	IMM = iota + 1

	// Address Mode: Implied
	// There is no additional data required for this instruction. The instruction
	// does something very simple like like sets a status bit. However, we will
	// target the accumulator, for instructions like PHA
	IMP

	// Address Mode: Indirect X/Y
	// The supplied 8-bit address indexes a location in page 0x00. From
	// here the actual 16-bit address is read, and the contents of
	// Y Register is added to it to offset it. If the offset causes a
	// change in page then an additional clock cycle is required.
	IZX
	IZY

	// Address Mode: Zero Page
	// To save program bytes, zero page addressing allows you to absolutely address
	// a location in first 0xFF bytes of address range. Clearly this only requires
	// one byte instead of the usual two.
	ZPG

	// Address Mode: Zero Page with X/Y Offset
	// Fundamentally the same as Zero Page addressing, but the contents of the X Register
	// is added to the supplied single byte address. This is useful for iterating through
	// ranges within the first page.
	ZPX
	ZPY

	// Address Mode: Relative
	// This address mode is exclusive to branch instructions. The address
	// must reside within -128 to +127 of the branch instruction, i.e.
	// you cant directly branch to any address in the addressable range.
	REL

	// Address Mode: Absolute
	// A full 16-bit address is loaded and used
	ABS

	// Address Mode: Absolute with X/Y Offset
	// Fundamentally the same as absolute addressing, but the contents of the Y Register
	// is added to the supplied two byte address. If the resulting address changes
	// the page, an additional clock cycle is required
	ABX
	ABY

	// Address Mode: Indirect
	// The supplied 16-bit address is read to get the actual 16-bit address. This is
	// instruction is unusual in that it has a bug in the hardware! To emulate its
	// function accurately, we also need to emulate this bug. If the low byte of the
	// supplied address is 0xFF, then to read the high byte of the actual address
	// we need to cross a page boundary. This doesnt actually work on the chip as
	// designed, instead it wraps back around in the same page, yielding an
	// invalid actual address
